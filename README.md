Python List Manipulation Assignment üìù
Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice Python built-in data structures, specifically lists. You will perform common operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding elements.

Steps Performed

Create an empty list

my_list = []


Started with an empty list to store numbers.

Append elements 10, 20, 30, 40

my_list.append(10)
my_list.append(20)
my_list.append(30)
my_list.append(40)


Added items one by one at the end of the list.

Insert 15 at the second position (index 1)

my_list.insert(1, 15)


Inserted 15 at index 1, shifting other elements to the right.

Extend the list with [50, 60, 70]

my_list.extend([50, 60, 70])


Added multiple elements at once from another list.

Remove the last element

my_list.pop()


Removed the last element (70) from the list.

Sort the list in ascending order

my_list.sort()


Ordered all elements from smallest to largest.

Find the index of the value 30

index_of_30 = my_list.index(30)
print("Index of 30:", index_of_30)


Found the position of 30 in the list (index 3).

Final List
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

Output
Index of 30: 3
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
